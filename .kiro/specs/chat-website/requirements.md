- **Chat_System**: The complete web-based messaging platform
- **User_Registry**: The authentication and user management subsystem
- **Message_Service**: The real-time messaging subsystem
- **Search_Engine**: The user discovery subsystem
- **API_Gateway**: The backend service interface for external applications
- **Unique_User_ID**: A system-generated identifier for each registered user
- **Chat_Session**: An active messaging conversation between two users
- **Real_Time_Connection**: WebSocket or similar persistent connection for instant messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to search for other users by their unique ID, so that I can start conversations with them
